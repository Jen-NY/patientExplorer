# patientExplorer
Shiny app for tumorbank queries and exploration of molecular and genetic results.

Explanation of the files:

randomData.R: Script to select random variants from downloaded sequencing data.

ampliconSeq_random_data.csv: An example table of sequencing results was generated by random selection of ICGC data (Study_genes_BRCA-ICGC), subsetted by breast cancer cancer consensus genes.

wes_random_data.csv: An example table of sequencing results was generated by random selection of ICGC data (Study_genes_CLL-ICGC).

report.Rmd: Script to generate a pdf report summarizing the genetic and molecular patient data. Reports are generated by activation of a button in the patientExplorer app and are saved in the reports folder.
